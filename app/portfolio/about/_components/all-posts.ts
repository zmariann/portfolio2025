  "My passion for visual arts has been with me since childhood. From an early age up to the present, I draw and paint whenever time allows. As I approached the end of high school, the only thing I knew for sure was that I wanted to do something creative. Out of curiosity I attended an open day for a photography course and ever since I have had a camera in my hands. In my free time, I create websites like this one or go hiking. I love listening to podcasts while retouching and try to practice yoga regularly.";

export const post2Content: string = "Currently, I take art reproduction photos for museums in Hungary and also create content for online platforms. Nowadays, regular photo and video content is an essential part of a successful social media presence. While a clumsy design or poor-quality video creates a negative impression and hides the strengths of your services, a well-thought-out visual presentation grabs attention, makes you stand out from the crowd, builds trust, strengthens your brand, and helps you convey what you truly represent. I can help you get the most out of your brand's online presence. Get in touch: CONTACT@ZMARIANN.COM";
