  "My passion for visual arts has been with me since childhood. From an early age up to the present, I draw and paint whenever time allows. As I approached the end of high school, the only thing I knew for sure was that I wanted to do something creative. Out of curiosity I attended an open day for a photography course and ever since I have had a camera in my hands. In my free time, I create websites like this one or go hiking. I love listening to podcasts while retouching and try to practice yoga regularly.";

  "At university, I completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in multimedia studies. During this time, I began building my photography portfolio, which I later complemented with video projects to adapt to the evolving demands of social media trends. I gained most of my experience in product photography and creating TikTok videos. Currently, I take art reproduction photos for museums in Hungary and also create content for online platforms.";
