  "My passion for visual arts has been with me since childhood. From an early age up to the present, I draw and paint whenever time allows. As I approached the end of high school, the only thing I knew for sure was that I wanted to do something creative. Out of curiosity I attended an open day for a photography course and ever since I have had a camera in my hands. Currently, I take art reproduction photos for museums in Hungary and also create content for online platforms.";
